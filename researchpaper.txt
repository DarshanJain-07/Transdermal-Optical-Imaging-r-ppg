## Implementation Architecture and Methodology

This section details the architecture and processing pipeline developed for robust remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) and Heart Rate (HR) estimation from facial videos. The methodology integrates advanced facial landmark detection, dual-path feature extraction addressing both temporal dynamics and illumination variations, and a tailored deep learning model for accurate HR regression.

**1. Preprocessing Pipeline:**

The initial stage focuses on standardizing the input video and preparing it for robust feature extraction.

*   **Input Handling & Standardization:** The system accepts standard video formats (e.g., MP4, AVI). A crucial first step involves standardizing the video frame rate to a consistent `TARGET_FPS` (30 fps). This is achieved using video processing libraries (like OpenCV with `VideoWriter`) to re-encode the video, ensuring uniform temporal sampling which is critical for subsequent temporal feature analysis (`convert_video_to_30fps` function in `preprocessing.py`). The standardized video serves as the input for the main processing loop.
*   **Face and Landmark Detection:** We employ the MediaPipe FaceLandmarker (`face_landmarker_v2_with_blendshapes.task`) configured for video mode (`VisionRunningMode.VIDEO`). This choice provides real-time performance and detects 478 facial landmarks per frame with high accuracy and robustness to moderate head poses (`initialize_face_landmarker`, `detect_face_and_landmarks_mediapipe` in `preprocessing.py`). The video mode leverages inter-frame tracking for temporal consistency. Detection results provide normalized landmark coordinates for each frame `t`, tagged with a precise timestamp `timestamp_ms = frame_index * (1000 / TARGET_FPS)`.
*   **ROI Definition and Extraction:** Three key facial Regions of Interest (ROIs) are targeted based on areas known for good blood perfusion and relative stability: the forehead, the left cheek (viewer's right), and the right cheek (viewer's left). Specific landmark indices (`FOREHEAD_POINTS`, `LEFT_CHEEK_POINTS`, `RIGHT_CHEEK_POINTS` in `preprocessing.py`) derived from the 478-point model are used to define these regions reliably across frames. For each ROI `k`, the corresponding landmark pixel coordinates `landmarks_px(t)` (denormalized from `detection_result` based on frame dimensions) are used to compute a tight bounding box (`get_bounding_box`). The raw pixel data `roi_raw_k(t)` is extracted from the frame using this bounding box (`extract_roi_frame`).
*   **ROI Standardization:** Each extracted raw ROI `roi_raw_k(t)` is resized to a fixed `ROI_SIZE` (64x64 pixels) using area interpolation (`cv2.resize` with `cv2.INTER_AREA`) and converted to `float32` data type (`current_roi_k`). This standardization ensures consistent input dimensions for the feature extraction modules, regardless of the original ROI size or distance from the camera. If landmark detection fails or an ROI is invalid (e.g., zero width/height), the `current_roi_k` is set to `None` for that frame.

**2. Dual-Path Feature Extraction:**

To capture complementary information related to both the subtle rPPG signal and confounding environmental factors, a dual-path feature extraction strategy is employed for each standardized ROI `current_roi_k(t)`.

*   **Path A: Temporal Wavelet Features:** This path focuses on capturing the temporal dynamics associated with blood volume changes.
    *   *Temporal Differencing:* The difference between the current standardized ROI and the previous one (`diff_k(t) = current_roi_k(t) - prev_roi_k`) is calculated. This highlights changes between frames, amplifying the rPPG signal relative to static features.
    *   *Multi-level 2D DWT:* A 3-level 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) using the 'db4' wavelet (`pywt.wavedec2`) is applied independently to each color channel of `diff_k(t)` (`_process_single_channel` in `feature_extraction.py`).
    *   *Subband Projection:* From the DWT coefficients, the Horizontal Detail (HL/cH) and Vertical Detail (LH/cV) subbands are extracted for each of the 3 decomposition levels. Horizontal projections (sum across columns) are calculated for HL bands, and vertical projections (sum across rows) for LH bands (`calculate_projections`).
    *   *Vector Construction:* Projections from all 3 levels (HL1, LH1, HL2, LH2, HL3, LH3) for a single channel are concatenated. These channel-specific vectors are then concatenated across all color channels to form the final wavelet feature vector `wavelet_fv_k(t)` for ROI `k` at time `t` (`extract_wavelet_features_from_diff`). This vector captures multi-scale temporal variations.

*   **Path B: Spatial Illumination-Robust Block Features:** This path aims to extract features robust to varying illumination conditions while retaining spatial information from the current frame `t`.
    *   *Multi-Scale Retinex (MSR):* The standardized `current_roi_k(t)` undergoes MSR processing (`apply_msr` in `feature_extraction.py`) using multiple Gaussian scales (e.g., 15, 80, 200). MSR enhances image contrast and normalizes for illumination by approximating and removing the illumination component.
    *   *RGB-MSR Fusion:* The original `current_roi_k(t)` (RGB) and its corresponding `msr_k(t)` are fused (`fuse_rgb_msr`). This involves calculating base layers (via mean filtering) and detail layers for both inputs. Saliency maps derived from the absolute detail layers are used to compute per-pixel weights, which then guide the fusion of the detail layers. The fused base and weighted fused detail layers are combined to produce the `fused_k(t)` image, integrating original color information with illumination-normalized features.
    *   *Block Averaging:* The `fused_k(t)` image is divided into a grid of `N x N` non-overlapping blocks (e.g., 4x4 = 16 blocks). The mean color value (e.g., mean R, G, B) is calculated within each block.
    *   *Vector Construction:* The mean values from all blocks are flattened into a single feature vector `current_block_fv_k(t)` (`extract_block_features`). This vector provides a spatially coarse but illumination-robust representation of the ROI at frame `t`.

*   **Feature Combination Strategy:** The core idea is to combine the temporal information from the wavelet features with the spatial context from the previous frame's block features. For each ROI `k`, if the wavelet feature vector `wavelet_fv_k(t)` (representing change from `t-1` to `t`) and the *previous* frame's block feature vector `prev_block_fv_k` (representing spatial context at `t-1`) are both available, they are concatenated: `combined_fv_k(t) = concat(wavelet_fv_k(t), prev_block_fv_k)`. This `combined_fv_k(t)` is appended to a list (`combined_features_roi_k`) specific to that ROI.

**3. Spatio-Temporal Image (STI) Construction:**

After processing all video frames, the sequence of combined feature vectors for each ROI is used to construct an STI.

*   **Stacking & Resizing:** For each ROI `k`, the list `combined_features_roi_k` (containing vectors `combined_fv_k(t)`) is vertically stacked using `np.vstack`. This creates a 2D matrix where rows correspond to time steps and columns represent the concatenated feature dimensions. This raw STI is then resized to the target `STI_SIZE` (224x224) using linear interpolation (`construct_and_resize_sti`), resulting in `final_STI_k`.
*   **Stacking for CNN Input:** The final STIs from the three ROIs (`final_STI_forehead`, `final_STI_left_cheek`, `final_STI_right_cheek`) are stacked along the channel dimension using `np.stack(..., axis=0)`. This creates a single 3-channel input tensor `stacked_input_sti` of shape (3, 224, 224), ready for the CNN.

**4. Enhanced HR Estimation CNN (`Enhanced_HR_CNN`):**

A deep learning model, detailed in `model.py`, processes the stacked STIs to estimate HR.

*   **Backbone:** A ResNet18 architecture, optionally initialized with ImageNet pre-trained weights (`use_pretrained=True`), serves as the backbone. Pre-training allows leveraging robust visual features learned on a large dataset.
*   **Input Adaptation:** The initial convolutional layer (`conv1`) of ResNet18 is modified to accept 3 input channels (the stacked STIs) instead of the standard 3 RGB channels. Weights are transferred appropriately if pre-training is used.
*   **Input Standardization:** Within the `forward` pass, the input batch is standardized (mean subtraction, division by standard deviation calculated across spatial dimensions) to stabilize training.
*   **Attention Mechanisms:** Self-attention blocks (`AttentionBlock`) are integrated after ResNet's `layer2` and `layer4`. These blocks allow the model to adaptively weight features across spatial locations based on context, effectively focusing on more informative regions within the STI feature maps.
*   **Multi-Scale Feature Fusion:** Features are extracted after key stages of the network: after `layer2` (plus attention), `layer3`, and `layer4` (plus attention). These feature maps are pooled using adaptive average pooling (`AdaptiveAvgPool2d`) to obtain fixed-size vectors, which are then concatenated (`f4_main, f3, f2`). This captures information at different levels of abstraction and spatial resolution.
*   **Regression Head:** The concatenated multi-scale features are fed into an `MLPHead`. This multi-layer perceptron (with hidden layers, BatchNorm, ReLU, and Dropout) provides greater expressive power for the final regression task compared to a single linear layer, mapping the rich feature representation to a single predicted HR value.
*   **Output:** The model outputs a single scalar value per input `stacked_input_sti`, representing the estimated HR.

**5. Training Strategy:**

The model is trained using the `HR_Trainer` class, incorporating several best practices:

*   **Loss Function:** A custom `HREstimationLoss` combines Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (L1), and a Negative Pearson Correlation component. The correlation term is crucial, encouraging the model to capture the temporal dynamics of the HR signal, not just minimize absolute error. Weights (`mse_weight`, `l1_weight`, `corr_weight`) balance these objectives.
*   **Optimizer:** AdamW (`optim.AdamW`) is used for its effectiveness in training deep networks, incorporating weight decay for regularization.
*   **Learning Rate Scheduling:** `ReduceLROnPlateau` dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on validation loss, helping convergence.
*   **Regularization:** Dropout within the `MLPHead` and weight decay in the optimizer combat overfitting. Gradient clipping (`clip_grad_norm_`) prevents exploding gradients.
*   **Augmentation:** Simple augmentations like random horizontal flips and noise addition (`_apply_augmentation` within `HR_Trainer`) are applied during training to improve robustness.

## Theoretical Justification and Design Choices

The design of the proposed system is grounded in physiological principles of rPPG and leverages established techniques from computer vision and signal processing, with specific choices made to enhance robustness and accuracy.

*   **MediaPipe FaceLandmarker:** Chosen for its real-time capability, robustness to variations in pose and illumination, and the detailed 478 landmarks it provides. This dense landmark set allows for precise and stable definition of facial ROIs compared to methods relying on simpler face detection or fewer landmarks.
*   **Target ROIs (Forehead, Cheeks):** These regions are selected based on physiological evidence suggesting strong plethysmographic signals due to high superficial blood vessel density. They also tend to exhibit less non-rigid motion compared to areas around the mouth or eyes, reducing motion artifacts. Using multiple ROIs provides redundancy and potentially captures slightly different signal characteristics.
*   **FPS Standardization (30fps):** Essential for consistent temporal analysis. The rPPG signal contains frequencies typically below 3Hz (180 BPM). A 30fps sampling rate comfortably satisfies the Nyquist criterion and aligns with common camera frame rates, providing sufficient temporal resolution for DWT analysis without excessive data redundancy.
*   **Dual-Path Feature Rationale:** rPPG signals are subtle and easily corrupted by motion and illumination changes. Relying solely on temporal features (like raw differences or basic transforms) makes the system vulnerable to illumination shifts, while purely spatial features might miss the faint rPPG signal. Our dual-path approach explicitly addresses both:
    *   *Wavelets (Path A):* DWT is well-suited for analyzing non-stationary signals like rPPG. The 'db4' wavelet offers a good balance between time and frequency localization. Multi-level decomposition captures signal variations across different time scales (frequencies). Projecting HL/LH subbands captures directional energy related to pulsatile changes, effectively summarizing the temporal dynamics. Differencing prior to DWT helps isolate the dynamic signal component.
    *   *MSR + Fusion + Block Avg (Path B):* MSR is a standard technique for illumination normalization in images, enhancing reflectance properties. Fusing it with the original RGB preserves color information while gaining illumination robustness. The specific fusion method (base/detail separation, saliency weighting) aims to intelligently combine the strengths of both representations. Block averaging provides spatial pooling, reducing noise and sensitivity to minor landmark jitter, yielding a compact, robust spatial descriptor for the frame.
*   **Feature Combination (Wavelet[t] + Block[t-1]):** This temporal staggering is deliberate. The wavelet features capture the *change* occurring between `t-1` and `t`. The block features provide the *spatial context* from frame `t-1`. Combining them allows the model to associate the current temporal change with the preceding spatial state, providing a richer context than using features solely from frame `t`.
*   **STI Representation:** Transforming the feature sequence into a 2D STI allows leveraging powerful Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), originally designed for image analysis. The STI encodes temporal evolution along one axis and feature dimensions along the other, enabling the CNN to learn spatio-temporal patterns. Resizing to 224x224 aligns with standard input sizes for pre-trained models like ResNet.
*   **CNN Architecture Choices:**
    *   *ResNet18 Backbone:* Offers a strong starting point with proven feature extraction capabilities, while being relatively computationally efficient compared to deeper models. Pre-training accelerates convergence and improves performance by initializing weights with meaningful image features.
    *   *Attention Blocks:* Standard CNNs treat all spatial locations equally after convolution. Attention mechanisms allow the model to learn the importance of different spatio-temporal locations within the STI feature maps, focusing computation on signal-rich areas and potentially suppressing noise or irrelevant background patterns. This is particularly relevant for STIs where the signal might be concentrated in specific feature columns or temporal rows.
    *   *Multi-Scale Features:* HR signals contain information across different frequency bands and temporal scales. Extracting and combining features from early (Layer 2), middle (Layer 3), and late (Layer 4) stages of the ResNet allows the model to capture both fine-grained details and broader temporal patterns present in the STI, leading to a more robust representation.
    *   *MLP Head:* The final mapping from learned features to a single HR value is complex. An MLP provides more modeling capacity than a single linear layer, allowing for non-linear combinations of the multi-scale features before the final regression output. BatchNorm and Dropout aid generalization in this critical stage.
*   **Custom Loss Function:** Standard MSE/L1 loss focuses only on magnitude errors. The rPPG task benefits significantly from preserving the temporal waveform characteristics. Including the Negative Pearson Correlation term directly penalizes predictions that are poorly correlated with the ground truth HR fluctuations, encouraging the model to learn the underlying physiological signal dynamics, leading to more plausible and stable HR estimates. The weighting allows balancing the importance of absolute accuracy versus temporal fidelity.

## Advantages Over Existing Methods

The proposed methodology offers several advantages compared to traditional or simpler rPPG techniques:

1.  **Enhanced Robustness:** The dual-path feature extraction explicitly tackles major challenges:
    *   **Illumination Variation:** Path B (MSR, Fusion, Block Features) provides inherent robustness against changing ambient light, a common failure point for methods relying solely on raw pixel values or simple color space transformations (like CHROM or POS).
    *   **Motion Artifacts:** While not eliminating severe motion, the temporal differencing and wavelet analysis (Path A) focus on *changes*, making them potentially less sensitive to slow drifts or static components introduced by slight movements than methods analyzing raw pixel values directly. The use of stable ROIs defined by dense landmarks further aids motion resilience.
2.  **Richer Feature Representation:** Combining wavelet-based temporal dynamics (Path A) with illumination-robust spatial context (Path B) creates a more comprehensive feature vector (`combined_fv_k`) than methods relying on a single feature type. This allows the CNN to learn from complementary information sources.
3.  **Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Focus:** The inclusion of Attention Blocks within the CNN allows the model to dynamically prioritize informative regions within the constructed STIs. This contrasts with standard CNNs that apply uniform processing, potentially improving performance by focusing on high-quality signal segments and suppressing noise.
4.  **Improved Regression via Multi-Scale Analysis:** Utilizing features from multiple depths of the CNN backbone enables the model to integrate both fine-grained and high-level abstract patterns within the STIs, leading to a potentially more accurate final HR regression via the MLP head compared to using only the final layer features.
5.  **Physiologically Relevant Learning Objective:** The custom `HREstimationLoss`, particularly the correlation component, guides the model to learn not just the average HR but also the temporal dynamics, which is often overlooked by standard regression losses, leading to potentially more stable and physiologically plausible estimations.
6.  **Leveraging Pre-training:** Using a pre-trained ResNet18 backbone allows the model to benefit from features learned on large-scale image datasets, potentially leading to better generalization and faster convergence compared to training a complex CNN entirely from scratch on limited rPPG data.

## Future Scope

While the proposed system demonstrates a robust approach, several avenues exist for future research and improvement beyond the immediate implementation tasks:

1.  **Advanced Data Augmentation:** Develop and incorporate more sophisticated rPPG-specific data augmentations, such as simulating realistic motion artifacts (jitter, rotation, translation within physiological bounds), synthetic variations in skin tone appearance, and diverse, challenging illumination scenarios (e.g., flickering lights, strong directional light).
2.  **Exploring Alternative Architectures:** Investigate the potential of replacing or complementing the ResNet backbone with architectures perhaps better suited for sequential or spatio-temporal data. This could include Vision Transformers (ViT) adapted for STI inputs, or hybrid CNN-RNN models (e.g., ConvLSTM layers) operating directly on feature sequences extracted per frame, potentially capturing longer-range temporal dependencies more explicitly than the current STI approach.
3.  **Cross-Dataset Generalization and Domain Adaptation:** Conduct rigorous evaluations on multiple diverse public datasets (e.g., PURE, UBFC-RPPG, V4V, MAHNOB-HCI) featuring variations in ethnicity, age, skin tone, lighting, and camera quality. Explore domain adaptation techniques (e.g., adversarial domain adaptation, feature alignment) to improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen conditions without retraining.
4.  **Personalization and Adaptation:** Investigate methods for adapting the pre-trained model to specific individuals using a small amount of calibration data. Techniques like transfer learning, meta-learning, or few-shot learning could potentially fine-tune the model to account for individual physiological differences or specific environmental factors, leading to personalized and more accurate HR monitoring.
5.  **Multi-Task Learning for Physiological Sensing:** Extend the model to predict other vital signs simultaneously, such as respiratory rate or SpO2 (if appropriate sensors/labels are available). Training a multi-task model might allow leveraging shared physiological information, potentially improving the accuracy of HR estimation through shared representation learning.
6.  **Explainability and Interpretability (XAI):** Apply XAI techniques like Grad-CAM, SHAP, or attention map visualization directly to the STIs and intermediate CNN layers. Understanding *which* spatio-temporal features or input regions the model deems important for prediction can build trust, reveal potential biases, and guide further architectural refinements or feature engineering efforts.
7.  **Real-time Optimization and Deployment:** Optimize the entire pipeline, from preprocessing to CNN inference, for efficient execution on target hardware (e.g., mobile CPUs/GPUs, edge AI accelerators). Techniques like model quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation could be employed to create a lightweight version suitable for real-time applications on resource-constrained devices.
